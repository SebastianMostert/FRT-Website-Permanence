TODO: The Admin User page needs extra stuff (like a btn to create a new user)
TODO: Add Dark/Light mode

TODO: Add status changing | Done for the Loge but the team needs a way to do it

TODO: We need a way to create teams (Admin Page)

TODO: Make changes to the API - More intuative, more secure, etc.

BIG CHANGES:
TODO: Add authentication with clerk or similar provider (safer, easier)
TODO: Change the way shifts are made:
    - Availabilities should be CONFIRMED by an admin
    - When confirming, the admin chooses a team to add the availability to
        - This availability will then become a shift
        - If the team is full LOCK IT
    - This shift will be displayed to all members
    - Members will be able to add themselves to the shift and specify the time period they are available for
        - This time period can be start before the shift starts and end after the shift ends
        - Any time before the shift starts will be created as a new availability
        - Any time after the shift ends will be created as a new availability
    - Admins will be able to edit the shift at any time
    - Admins can "lock" the shift so users cannot add themselves to it anymore
